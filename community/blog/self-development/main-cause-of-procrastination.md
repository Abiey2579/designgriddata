# Main Cause of Procrastination

### What is Procrastination?

Procrastination is simply the act of delaying or postponing tasks or activities, lying to yourself that you’re going to do it later.

### Main Cause of Procrastination?

The main cause of procrastination is not having a “clear goal” or “achievable goal”. Not having an achievable goal can be detrimental to one’s motivation and sense of purpose. Without a clear target to work towards, it can be difficult to stay focused and make progress, and as a result Procrastination comes in.

### How to avoid Procrastination?

1. Make sure your goal is specific and clearly defined. Avoid being too general or vague.
2. Break your goal down into smaller, manageable tasks. This will make it easier to focus on the steps required to achieve your goal.
3. Set deadlines for yourself to help you stay on track and make sure you are making progress.
4. Identify any obstacles or challenges that may arise and come up with a plan to overcome them.
5. Stay motivated by reminding yourself of why your goal is important and what the benefits of achieving it will be.
6. Get support from friends, family, or a mentor. They can provide you with guidance and help you stay accountable.
7. Celebrate your progress and reward yourself for achieving milestones along the way.

Be honest with yourself, if your goal is not working as planned, re-evaluate it and make the necessary adjustments.
