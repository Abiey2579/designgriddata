# The Power of **“Yet”**

The power of the word **“yet”** have a significant impact on our mindset, motivation, and overall success. People who used **“yet”** a lot tend to learn more faster than those who don’t.

Picture the difference between the following sentences: **“I can’t do this”** and **“I can’t do this, yet”**.

It’s easy to become discouraged when you say **“I can’t do this.”** However, by adding the word **“yet”** to the end of that sentence, it changes the entire meaning. **“I can’t do this yet”** implies that while you may not have the ability or knowledge to accomplish the task at the moment, but you will in the future.

Using **“yet”** also help remind us that failure is not the end, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow. It also help us to be more patient with ourselves and others, as we recognize that progress takes time, because slow success builds character, while fast success builds ego.

By incorporating **“yet”** into our goals, we are acknowledging that we have not yet reached our desired outcome, but that we are working towards it. This helps to keep us focused on the steps we need to take to get there, rather than getting discouraged by the end goal being out of reach.

In summary, the power of **“yet”** help us to stay motivated, persevere in the face of challenges, maintain perspective, and set and achieve goals. It is a small word with big potential. By incorporating it into our vocabulary and mindset, we can become more resilient and successful in life.

I have a goal too, that I want to work at **“Microsoft”**, I want to be among the software engineers who made significant contributions to the world of technology, I may not have the skills **“yet”**, but with hard work and determination, I know I can achieve my goal.

Stay Motivated 💪💪
