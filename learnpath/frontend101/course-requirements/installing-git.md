4. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file and run the installer.
5. Follow the installation wizard instructions. You can typically accept the default settings unless you have specific preferences.
6. During the installation process, you may be prompted to choose components to install. Ensure that the "Git Bash" option is selected, as it provides a command-line interface for Git on Windows.
