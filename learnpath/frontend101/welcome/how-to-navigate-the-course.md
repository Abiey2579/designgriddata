# How to Navigate the Course

Working and collaborating with other people is an important part of working as a web developer. Therefore, we at The Odin Project encourage you to participate in our online chat community, which we’ll talk more about below. By joining the community, you can grow alongside other Odinites and help each other learn web development. While you’re at it, you can check out our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter and catch up on Instagram. Use #TheOdinProject to share your Odin Project progress, updates, thoughts and to see what other Odin students are up to!

## Why a Community Is Awesome for You

Learning web development will be a long and arduous journey, but you can make the marathon a lot more fun by getting involved in our Discord community. No matter what pace you are doing our curriculum, there will always be people a few steps ahead of you that are willing to help. Furthermore, helping others that are a few steps behind you is a great way to deepen your own understanding and make your learning stick.

When you’re slogging through the desert of despair, where your code doesn’t work or even make sense to you anymore, you can find an oasis of knowledge and encouragement in our community. Veterans at The Odin Project love to help fill in knowledge gaps and provide new insights and perspectives on how to improve your code. We’ve all been there before!

Remember that project you struggled so hard to figure out and that you’re so proud of finishing? Through our community, you will get to share your work and progress with those who fully appreciate how much hard work went into it.

## Why a Community Is Awesome for Odin

We are working hard to update existing lessons and produce new content, so we would love to hear your feedback on the lessons and projects. We hope you find the lessons fun, engaging, and informative and find the projects challenging but achievable. So please let us know your thoughts!

## Before Asking for Help

As most of the projects are designed to push you to your limit, please remember that there is always a community to turn to! You don’t need to know how to solve every problem straight away, BUT you do need to have a general idea of where you are going. This becomes really important when asking your questions because sometimes the problem is your approach and not your code.

If you’re feeling stuck, it’s a good time to pause and take a breather. Break the problem down into little pieces and then decide what is really holding you back. We call this technique rubber duck debugging.

You should also do a Google search to find relevant information for your problem. Read about how to use Google to solve your programming questions. You can also look back at previous lessons for tools that you can apply to the current task.

If these methods don’t yield a solution for you, then it’s time to reach out to the Odin community and ask for help.

## Asking for Help

So you’ve spent some time struggling to solve the problem on your own, and now it’s time to fire up the Odin Discord and ask for help. The first thing to keep in mind is don’t ask to ask. While this is a simple idea (with a pretty catchy motto!), it can help you get answers to your questions much faster and will make it easier to others to feel comfortable offering you help.

In addition, when you ask your questions, you should help the community help you by putting together a great question.

When asking your question, please remember to include the context:

- What do you think the problem is?
- What exactly do you want to happen?
- What is actually happening?
- How did you get there?
- What have you tried so far?

If you can’t pinpoint the problem, you can share a screenshot. This is especially useful for showing the output of commands in the command line. In Discord, drag and drop your screenshot image file into the chat box to upload it or simply use the PrtScn and paste keyboard shortcuts. If you don’t know how to take a screenshot on your computer, this is a good time to ask Google.

Screenshots are great for showing the output of commands or error messages in the command line. Screenshots are also great for showing the output from your code such as how the output looks visually on a webpage or console outputs in the browser. However, you should always include the corresponding files containing the error. Even if it is a short amount of code, providing it in the discord server in the proper format along with a screenshot of the output is helpful to those debugging it rather than just a screenshot. When you do share a screenshot of the output or how it looks visually make sure to push your project to GitHub or put your corresponding code in a Replit so that others can comb through and debug the code. The screenshot of the output and the correlating code that can recreate the problem will help make it easier to understand the problem for people helping you. You’ll learn all about GitHub very soon.

Sometimes there might be no one around to help you with your issue. That is the ideal time to get familiar with the Discord search function. Search for specific keywords or error messages to see if anyone else had a similar issue before and how they solved it!

## Formatting Your Questions

Asking your questions in a readable format helps everyone debug them better. Here are some ways to go about that:

    If you’re having trouble on the command line, make sure to include both your input and the error message you’re getting.
