# How to Navigate the Course:

Learning and navigating through the course is made easy with our user-friendly website structure. To make the most of your learning journey, here's a guide on how to effectively navigate the course:

### **Sidebar Navigation:**

The left sidebar lists all the topics covered in the course. Each topic expands to display its corresponding lessons. Use the sidebar to explore different topics and select the lesson you want to dive into.

### **Main Lesson Area:**

The main area of the website displays the content of the selected lesson. Read through the lesson carefully, paying attention to the concepts, examples, and exercises provided. Make sure to grasp the core ideas before moving on.

### **Next and Previous Buttons:**

At the bottom of each lesson, you'll find 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons. These buttons allow you to seamlessly navigate between lessons. The 'Next' button takes you to the next lesson in the sequence, while the 'Previous' button takes you back to the previous lesson. The buttons are labeled with the names of the corresponding lessons, making it easy to track your progress.

### **Marking Lessons as Completed:**

As you progress through the course, remember to click the 'Next' button after completing a lesson. This action marks the current lesson as completed, helping you track your progress and ensuring a comprehensive learning experience. By completing each lesson, you build a solid foundation for the upcoming topics.

### **Importance of Following the Course Order:**

It's highly recommended to follow the course in the intended order without skipping any lessons. Each lesson builds upon the previous ones, gradually expanding your knowledge and skills. If you attempt to access a lesson that is marked as incomplete, an alert will remind you to complete the previous lessons first. This approach ensures a cohesive learning journey and enables you to grasp the concepts effectively.

By following these navigation guidelines, you'll be able to navigate the course seamlessly, stay on track, and make the most out of your learning experience. Enjoy the journey and happy learning! üßë‚Äçüíªs
