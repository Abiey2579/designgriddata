# HTML Styling Tags

This Lesson covers various tags used for text styling in HTML. Here are some commonly used styling tags with explanations:

1. `<b>` tag:
   The `<b>` tag is used to apply bold formatting to the enclosed text. It represents strong emphasis, indicating that the text is of higher importance.

   Example:

   ```html
   <p>This is a <b>bold</b> text.</p>
   ```

2. `<em>` tag:
   The `<em>` tag is used to apply emphasis or italic formatting to the enclosed text. It indicates that the text has a different emphasis or should be read with stress.

   Example:

   ```html
   <p>This is an <em>italicized</em> text.</p>
   ```

3. `<i>` tag:
   The `<i>` tag is used to apply italic formatting to the enclosed text. It is used to represent text in a slightly different tone or style.

   Example:

   ```html
   <p>This is <i>italic</i> text.</p>
   ```

4. `<u>` tag:
   The `<u>` tag is used to underline the enclosed text. It is typically used to represent hyperlinks or signify special emphasis.

   Example:

   ```html
   <p>This is <u>underlined</u> text.</p>
   ```

5. `<s>` tag:
   The `<s>` tag is used to apply strikethrough formatting to the enclosed text. It is often used to indicate that the text has been deleted or is no longer valid.

   Example:

   ```html
   <p>This is <s>strikethrough</s> text.</p>
   ```

6. `<strong>` tag:
   The `<strong>` tag is used to represent strongly emphasized text. It has a similar purpose to the `<b>` tag but is often used to convey semantic meaning rather than just visual styling.

   Example:

   ```html
   <p>This is <strong>strongly emphasized</strong> text.</p>
   ```

7. `<sup>` and `<sub>` tags:
   The `<sup>` tag is used to represent superscript text, which is positioned above the normal line of text. The `<sub>` tag is used to represent subscript text, which is positioned below the normal line of text.

   Example:

   ```html
   <p>
     This is a<sup>superscript</sup> and this is a<sub>subscript</sub> text.
   </p>
   ```
