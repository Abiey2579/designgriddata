# Headings and Paragraphs

Headings and paragraphs are fundamental elements in HTML used to structure and organize content on a web page. Headings are used to define the hierarchy and importance of different sections, while paragraphs are used to represent blocks of text or content.

In HTML, headings are organized into different levels to provide hierarchical structure to the content. There are six levels of headings in HTML, ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. Here's an explanation of each level:

- `<h1>`: This represents the highest level heading, typically used for the main heading or the title of the page. It carries the most importance and should be used sparingly.
- `<h2>`: This represents a subheading that is one level below the `<h1>` heading. It is typically used to group related content under the main heading.
- `<h3>`: This represents a subheading that is one level below the `<h2>` heading. It can be used to further divide and categorize content within a section.
- `<h4>`: This represents a subheading that is one level below the `<h3>` heading. It can be used to provide additional subcategories or topics within a section.
- `<h5>`: This represents a subheading that is one level below the `<h4>` heading. It can be used for further subdivisions within a section or to denote a lesser importance.
- `<h6>`: This represents the lowest level heading, typically used for minor headings or subsections within a larger section.

Here's an example of how you can use headings within the HTML boilerplate:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's an example of how you can use paragraph within the HTML boilerplate:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>

```

Now let's start coding, to create a new HTML file and preview your code in a browser using Sublime Text, follow these steps:

1. Open Sublime Text and go to **File** in the menu bar.
2. Click on **New File** to create a new file.
3. In the new file, copy and paste below code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
    <p>This is a how you can use paragraphs in html</p>
    <p>Here's another exampl</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

4. Save the file with an appropriate name and the `.html` extension. For example, you can save it as `index.html`.
5. Once your HTML file is saved, Right click anywhere in code and select "Open in Browser".
6. Sublime Text will open the HTML file in your default browser, allowing you to preview your code.
