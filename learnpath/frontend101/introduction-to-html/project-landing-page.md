# Project: Landing Page

It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

### Setting Up Your Project’s GitHub Repository

As mentioned in the introduction to Git, you’ll want to organize all your projects like a portfolio and link them to GitHub so it can be seen by others.

If you do not know how to set up a repository, follow the instructions found in **Installing Git Lesson** to learn how.

1. Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it landing-page.
2. Open directory you want to keep you project, right-click and select `open in terminal`
3. Go to GitHub and copy your repository link
   ![Copy Repository Link 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abiey2579/designgriddata/master/learnpath/assets/images/project-landing-page-1.jpg)
   ![Copy Repository Link 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abiey2579/designgriddata/master/learnpath/assets/images/project-landing-page-2.jpg)

4. In the command line type `git clone <paste your link here>` and click enter
5. When its done cloning, cd into the project directory like `cd landing-page`
6. Set up your `README.md` file and write a brief introduction describing what the project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
